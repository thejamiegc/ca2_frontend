This is the Frontend template for CA2.

by Felicia, Jamie, Isak & Helena

If you wish to use the Frontend application, these are the pages you will need to change:

In src/routes, you will need to add a jsx-file for your api.
-> Use the "Joke.jsx"-file as template if needed

In src/App.jsx you will need to add the routes to the return method

In src/settings.js you will need to add the URL as a const, after that in src/apiFacade.js you will need to import the url's you wish to use, in the top.

After you have added the url's to settings.js, you also need to import the url's to the top of your routes-file.
